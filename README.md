## Current Focus

Engineering AI that can do more — expanding the inputs agents can perceive and the tools they can operate, while keeping everything auditable. Building skills and infrastructure in the OpenClaw ecosystem under a Scope-First framework: define the boundary, then let intelligence emerge freely within it.

## Production Work

- **RAG Policy Chatbot** — Designed and deployed a RAG chatbot for a state government eligibility system. PoC → Pilot → Statewide (3,000+ caseworkers). Built the LLM evaluation pipeline (Ragas, 25 Golden Questions) now used as the client's standard for all model upgrades.
- **LLM Code Generation Platform** — GPT-4-powered natural language → Python/SQL for a federal financial department. Code preview, one-click execution, full audit trail for compliance.
- **Document AI Accelerator** — End-to-end OCR evaluation platform. Synthetic data pipeline (1,000+ docs, 3 languages, 81 handwriting fonts), 95%+ field-level accuracy.
